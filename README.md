# Instructions to run

The purpose of this repository is to provide a quick introduction to Spectre simulations via the terminal. I used Python scrits that modify a netlitst, it is possible to make a completely new netlist too, which regenerates with each new simulation.

Sometimes we need to perform many simulations, and save the data. But saving each of the simulations was not practical, and I spent time on it.

I found some alternatives to open the files and run a Spectre simulation using Python. The list below presents some libraries and repositories on github for this:

...intems

In this repository, I perform a transient simulation of a resistor, which receives a ramp at the input. The library I used to read the simulation results can be found at this link.
